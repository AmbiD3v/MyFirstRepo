Brief Introduction About Myself.
Hello World, I am Rachael but I do go with various names such as Rey, Kenia or Rael. I am a passionate learner and love challenges that test my grit and patience. Even though they might me overwhelming, they do build me because I cant godown so easily.
I am learning everyday and that is what matters.
